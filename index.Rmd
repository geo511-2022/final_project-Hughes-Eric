# Introduction 

Access to healthy food is not equal across all regions. Many factors influence food access such as income (Walker et al., 2010), vehicle access (Crowe et al., 2018), and proximity to quality grocery retailers (Moore & Diez Roux, 2006). The most basic measure of food access is proximity to supermarkets because supermarkets have the resources to carry a wide range of products and have affordable prices (Moore & Diez Roux, 2006; Sallis et al., 1986), making their presence a good measure of local food security. Using Moore & Diez’s (2006) definition of a supermarket, only grocery stores with 50 or more employees are considered supermarkets.

This project aims to look at Buffalo residents’ proximity to supermarkets based on their median household income and access to a vehicle. To do this, two analyses will be run. For the first, Buffalo residents will be grouped into four different income brackets based on their median household income per census tract. Then, the distance to the nearest supermarket for each census tract will be calculated. All census tracts within the same bracket will be averaged. For the second analysis, Buffalo residents will be grouped into four brackets based on the proportions of households within each census tract without access to a personal vehicle. Then, the distance to the nearest supermarket for each census tract will be calculated. All census tracts within the same bracket will be averaged. To calculate distances for each census tract, each census tract polygon will first be converted to a centroid. Results will be compared and discussed in the Results and Conclusions sections.

## Plots for median household income and vehicle access

The plot for median household income shows where supermarkets are in relation to each census tract and each census tract's income bracket. 

```{r, message=F, warning=F}

income_supermarket <- ggmap(basemap) +
  geom_sf(data = income_proj, aes(x = INTPTLON, y = INTPTLAT,  fill = median.household.income), 
          inherit.aes = F)+
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "yellow", high = "red") +
  geom_point(data = bf_supermarkets, aes(x = xlon, y = ylat, color = "Supermarket"), size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = "green", name = "Supermarkets") +
  labs(title="All supermarkets within 0.5-miles of Buffalo, NY (2020)",
       subtitle="Median income data",
       caption="Median household income data from US Census Bureau,
       supermarket data from Data Axle",
       x = "Longitude",
       y = "Latitude") +
  theme(legend.direction = "vertical", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.9, hjust=1))+
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Median Household Income ($)", order = 1)) 
income_supermarket  

```

The plot for vehicle access data shows where supermarkets are in relation to each census tract and each census tract's vehicle access bracket. 

```{r, message=F, warning=F}

vehicle_supermarket <- ggmap(basemap) +
  geom_sf(data = vehicle_proj, aes(x = INTPTLON, y = INTPTLAT,  fill = prop.wo.va),

## Summary tables

The median household income data table shows that there was not an obvious pattern of supermarket distribution based on median household income. The highest median income bracket did on average have the shortest distance to a supermarket, but the other three brackets had similar distances with the bracket "Between 20K and 40K" with the furthest distance.
```{r, message=F, warning=F}

income_bracket <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 1, nrow = 4))
colnames(income_bracket) = "Income bracket ($)"
income_bracket[1,1] = "20k or less"
income_bracket[2,1] = "Between 20K and 40k"
income_bracket[3,1] = "Between 40k and 60k"
income_bracket[4,1] = "More than 60k"

income_dists <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 1, nrow = 4))
colnames(income_dists) = "Average distance to nearest supermarket (miles)"
income_dists[1,1] = round(ave_dist_less_than_20k / 1609.344, digits = 2)
income_dists[2,1] = round(ave_dist_less_than_40k / 1609.344, digits = 2)
income_dists[3,1] = round(ave_dist_less_than_60k / 1609.344, digits = 2)
income_dists[4,1] = round(ave_dist_greater_than_60k / 1609.344, digits = 2)

income_table_combine <- cbind(income_bracket,income_dists)

income_table <- kableExtra::kable(income_table_combine) 

kable_styling(income_table, "striped", position = "left", font_size = 12, html_font = "arial")

```

The vehicle access data table reveals a pattern where people with less access to a vehicle have further distances to travel to reach a supermarket.
```{r, message=F, warning=F}

vehicle_bracket <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 1, nrow = 4))
colnames(vehicle_bracket) = "Vehicle access bracket"
vehicle_bracket[1,1] = "Less than 20% of households don't have access to a vehicle"
vehicle_bracket[2,1] = "Between 20% and 40% of households don't have access to a vehicle"
vehicle_bracket[3,1] = "Between 40% and 60% of households don't have access to a vehicle"
vehicle_bracket[4,1] = "More than 60% of households don't have access to a vehicle"

vehicle_dists <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 1, nrow = 4))
colnames(vehicle_dists) = "Average distance to nearest supermarket (miles)"
vehicle_dists[1,1] = round(ave_dist_less_than_0.2 / 1609.344, digits = 2)
vehicle_dists[2,1] = round(ave_dist_less_than_0.4 / 1609.344, digits = 2)
vehicle_dists[3,1] = round(ave_dist_less_than_0.6 / 1609.344, digits = 2)
vehicle_dists[4,1] = round(ave_dist_greater_than_0.6 / 1609.344, digits = 2)

vehicle_table_combine <- cbind(vehicle_bracket,vehicle_dists)

vehicle_table <- kableExtra::kable(vehicle_table_combine)

kable_styling(vehicle_table, "striped", position = "left", font_size = 12, html_font = "arial")
```
  

# Conclusions

The results for the median household income data were a bit surprising. Given that supermarkets tend to favor more affluent neighborhoods, expectations were that as each income bracket increased in wealth, the distance would decrease. While the highest earners had to travel the least distance, the other three brackets did not show a linear progression of decreasing distances as income increased. However, the vehicle access data yielded the expected results. As the proportion of households’ access to vehicles decreased, the average distance to supermarkets increased. This is expected because people without access to a vehicle typically come from vulnerable communities where supermarkets are less inclined to enter. 

Further research could be done by examining demographic variables such as race and education. By looking into these variables, further insights could be gained to further explain food access and the distribution of supermarkets in Buffalo, NY.
